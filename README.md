# My First Project

This Firebase-centered app (for personal learning purposes) simply follows the video tutorial series created by Net Ninja that can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfA3NWDBPZ4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9j--TKIdkb3ISfRbJeJYQwC&index=1.

As the title above in this README explains however, this is also my first Github repo that I've decided to push.
